# Safebooru-Multitag-ClassifyML

Objective: Using machine learning algorithm resnet50 to tag anime image automatically.

Project: Tags an anime image using multiclassifier algorithm using Safebooru datasets.

Summary: Download anime image and its tag from Safebooru. Extract the tags into classes and implement multi label classification algorithm. Train the model and test anime images randomly.

Implementation: Download xml file using Safebooru api, compile file_url into links text file.
Map file name of the link to its tag into safebooru.csv. Train the model and deploy into production.

Note: The file is in Jupyter Notebook format, open in Google Colab or Jupyter.

This project is for learning purpose only, it is not optimized and full of clunky code that no sane person should ever use.
